"Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II (/stfn/ STEF-n; born March 14 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the point guard position. Many analysts and players have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history. He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to regularly utilize the three-point shot. A seven-time NBA All-Star Curry has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice and has won three NBA championships with the Warriors.
"
"The son of former NBA player Dell and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. He set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference and was twice named the conference's player of the year. During his sophomore year Curry also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.
"
"In 201415 Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 504090. That same year the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017 2018 and 2019 winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018 before being defeated by the Toronto Raptors in 2019.
"
"During the 201213 season Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286 and again in 2016 with 402. He is currently second in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history. Curry and teammate Klay Thompson have earned the nickname of the Splash Brothers; in 201314 they set the record for combined three-pointers in an NBA season with 484 a record they broke the following season (525) and again in the 201516 season (678).
"
Early life
"Wardell Stephen Curry II is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron Ohio at Summa Akron City Hospital (the same hospital where LeBron James had been born 3 years earlier) while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He grew up in Charlotte North Carolina where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets. Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups. The family briefly relocated to Toronto where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors. During this time Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team leading them to an undefeated season. He was also a member of Toronto 50 a club team that plays across Ontario pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk. Curry led the team to a 334 record en route to winning the provincial championship.
"
"Following Dell's retirement the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School where he was named all-conference all-state and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame. He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.
"
College career
Freshman season
"Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event ""Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special."" In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against Michigan he scored 32 points dished out 4 assists and grabbed 9 rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 295 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2 2007 in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for 3-point field goals.
"
"Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6 2007. On March 15 2007 Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13 seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points Davidson lost 8270. At the end of his freshman season Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year SoCon Tournament MVP and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team All-freshman team and first-team All-SoCon. He was also honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major.

He led the Wildcats to a 266 regular-season record and a 200 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play Davidson earned its third straight NCAA Tournament bid.
"
"On March 21 2008 Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969 8276. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from 3-point range. On March 23 Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown ranked eighth nationally entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 7470 comeback victory.

"
"Prior to the start of the 201213 season Curry signed a four-year $44 million contract extension with the Warriors. At the time many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.

"
NBA championship and MVP (20142015)
"Prior to the start of the 201415 season the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach.

Many felt that he should have won Finals MVP. In response Curry stated ""At the end of the day I'm not going to let a [Finals] MVP trophy define my career. Three titles ... Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ... I'm a three-time champ."" Rohan Nadkarni of Sports Illustrated argued that ""the Golden State dynasty started with Stephen Curry. He for numerous reasons stretching from his incredible talent to his previous ankle injuries put the Warriors in place to win their third championship in four seasons.""

"
201920 season
"Curry was expected to take on a greater offensive load in the 201920 season with Thompson out injured and Kevin Durant having left the Warriors as a free agent. On October 30 2019 against the Phoenix Suns in the fourth game of the season Curry drove to the basket and collided with the Suns' Aron Baynes who was trying to take a charge. Baynes fell on Curry's left hand which required surgery to repair his broken second metacarpal. He was expected to be out at least three months. On March 5 2020 Curry returned against the Raptors and recorded 23 points six rebounds and seven assists in a 121113 Warriors' loss.
"
202021 season
"On December 27 2020 Curry put up 36 points in a 129128 win over the Chicago Bulls. With this game he joined Ray Allen and Reggie Miller as the only players to have scored more than 2500 career three-pointers in NBA history.

"
"On April 12 Curry scored 53 points in a 116107 win against the Denver Nuggets and he surpassed Chamberlain (17783) to become the franchise's all-time scoring leader. It was part of an 11-game stretch in April in which Curry scored at least 30 points each game surpassing Kobe Bryant's previous record for a player age 33 or older. Curry also had 78 three-pointers during that span the most in NBA history over 11 regular season games. His play rekindled talk of him being a candidate for his third MVP award. He was named the Western Conference Player of the Month for April after averaging 37.3 points on 51.8% shooting scoring 30 or more points in 13 of his 15 games. He became first NBA player to average 35 points and shoot 504090 in a calendar month. His 96 three-pointers were an NBA record for a month breaking James Harden's mark of 82 set in November 2019. Curry made 46.6% of his 3's in that span including four games in which he made 10 or more 3-pointers. He scored 46 points in the regular-season finale against Memphis to hold off Bradley Beal and secure his second scoring title finishing with a 32.0 point average.
"
National team career
"Curry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal. In 2010 he was selected to the senior squad playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (known later as FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament. In 2014 he took on a larger role with the team helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game. On June 6 2016 Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.
"
Player profile
"Listed at 6 feet 3 inches tall (1.91 m) and weighing 190 pounds (86kg) Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 23.5 points 6.6 assists 4.5 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game. He is a high-percentage free throw shooter with a career free throw percentage of 90.6% through the end of the 201920 season the highest in NBA history. Curry is the Warriors' all-time free-throw leader and has led the NBA in free throw percentage four times. He has been selected to six All-NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice. As a leader within the Warriors organization he played a significant role in the recruitment of former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors.
"
"Although capable of stealing the ball having led the league in steals for the 201516 season Curry has faced criticism for his defense. He is used more for his offense while his teammates Klay Thompson and Draymond Green take on more defensive assignments. Some analysts including Ethan Sherwood Strauss of ESPN have complimented his defensive play or stated that it is underrated. Strauss commented in 2015 that Curry became ""one of the NBA's most effective defenders -- ranking fifth among point guards in defensive real plus-minus.""
"
"Curry's shooting ability ranges from scoring in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half-court. Using an unorthodox jump shot he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block. The shooting proficiency earned him the nickname ""Baby-Faced Assassin"" during his pre-NBA years and ""Chef Curry"" while in the NBA. He is additionally known for his ball handling and playmaking abilities and for putting extra pressure on defenses with his long range leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016. As of January 2019 Curry ranks third in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three-pointers made. He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2000 career three-pointers doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder Ray Allen. A clutch scorer he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments and takes game-winning shots.
"
"NBA analysts state that Curry's efficient scoring ability creates a ""gravity"" effect forcing opposing defenders to double-team him even when he does not have the ball which creates mismatches that his teammates are able to exploit. With Curry the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense down and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates Tom Haberstroh of NBC Sports stated ""You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player. [...] The Warriors go from plus-16.9 to plus-14.8 to plus-13.9 to plus-14.3 as you keep removing an All-Star from Curry. But as these numbers show Curry is impervious. He's teammate-agnostic. For those that think Curry would struggle in another organization or in another system it's clear: He is the system.""
"
Legacy
"Curry is considered to be the greatest shooter in NBA history. He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring basketball teams from high school to the NBA to regularly utilize the three-point shot. Analysts have referred to him as ""the Michael Jordan of the three-point era"" stating that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the dunk. The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27 2013 game against the New York Knicks in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a 54-point performance as the start of the three-point era. The era has been referred to as ""The Steph Effect"" and ""the NBA's Three-Point Revolution.""
"
"Before Curry shooting behind the three-point line was more of a novelty an occasional way of scoring. Catch and shoot players existed but Curry's success inspired the league to abandon physical play around the basket and to embrace a pace and space and three-point shooting style. The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range. Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique. Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet. He shoots 54 percent from this range while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet. He can make the shots with elite ball handling off the dribble and often with an extremely quick release from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him. Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time. Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that ""coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to his game is built on fundamentals"" and that ""while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays the root of their success is ball movement.""
"
"Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that ""one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range"" and that ""Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever."" Sally Jenkins of The Washington Post stated that he ""moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze"" and that a highlight is the ""sheer preposterousness of his shots and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them."" She said that ""in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet."" Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination ""is as great as anyone I've ever seen."" Jeff Austin of Octagton concluded that Curry ""had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet."" Goldsberry stated that ""no player in the history of the NBA has combined range volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry"" and that ""Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet."" His range and efficiency drove the developers of the NBA 2K video game series in which Curry is featured to worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen.
"
"Where Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate. Former NBA player Steve Nash who is also among the NBA's all-time efficient shooters said Curry is ""already an all-time great"" and that people question his greatness ""because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates."" Scottie Pippen who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls said that Curry's ""willingness to sacrifice for [Kevin Durant] is one of the great stories in history"" because Curry welcomed Durant who is also a top player to the Warriors without ego. ""If you have a mind for the game you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win"" he said crediting Curry with being ""one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen."" CBS Sports ranked Curry #19 in their list of ""50 greatest NBA players of all time"". Sports Illustrated ranked him #3 behind Durant and LeBron James on their ""Top 100 NBA Players of 2019"" list. Sports Illustrated stated that ""Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system"" and that ""the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation.""

Off the court
Personal life
"On July 30 2011 Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte.

"
"Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith. He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying ""People should know who I represent and why I am who I am and that's because of my Lord and Savior."" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a ""heart for God"" and as a reminder that he plays for God. On some of his ""Curry One"" basketball shoes there is a lace loop scripted ""4:13"". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 which reads ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (""Love never fails...""). Curry is also an investor in Active Faith a Christian sports apparel brand.

In August 2019 Curry and Howard University a historically black institution in Washington D.C. jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 202021 school year with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years. Curry is also a fan of British soccer club Chelsea FC.

"Monte Poole of NBC Sports on Curry's popularity
"
"Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA and he has also become an international celebrity on par with four-time MVP LeBron James. Like James he has been considered the face of the NBA but has said that he is not motivated by that and is not looking ""to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know I'm trying to chase rings and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me."" His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA. Curry's jersey was the top seller in the NBA for the 201516 and 201617 NBA seasons.
"
"ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes while Forbes has ranked him among the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements. ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk everyone can attempt a shot which is something Curry inspires. Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment stating ""After all not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism but everyone can learn to pass dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough you can still find ways to dominate no matter your size.""
"
"Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be ""the most human of superstars"" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that ""the joy factor exponentially increases"" when Curry is on the court and that ""the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans.""
"

According to his sister Suzanne Deah Barakat was known for his ""love for basketball and anything Steph Curry."" Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30 and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ. Curry said that Barakat's family ""did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality [...] It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family [...] I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully they know that I've been thinking about them.""
